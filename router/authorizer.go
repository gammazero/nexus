	// is included in the ERROR response to the client.
	//
	// Since the Authorizer accesses both the sending session and the message
	// through a pointer, the authorizer can alter the content of both the
	// sending session and the message.  This allows the authorizer to also
	// work as an interceptor of messages that can change their content and/or
	// change the sending session based on the intercepted message.  This
	// functionality may be used to set values in the session upon encountering
	// certain messages sent by that session.
